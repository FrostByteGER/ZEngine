# ZEngine
![.NET Core](https://github.com/FrostByteGER/ZEngine/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

Portable Game Engine written in C# .NET Core 3.1(.NET 5 soon) with Vulkan and OpenGL backends.

## Visual Studio
Currently there is no build system for the project itself as Premake doesn't support .NET Core 3.1 yet. 
Therefore a premade visual studio solution is provided.

## Render Backends
* Vulkan 1.2

## ZenForge
ZenForge is the WIP editor built around ZEngine. Currently it doesn't do much
